## Purpose

This is an as-of-yet unnamed website that I am developing. I've noticed that as algorithms improve and content becomes more and more provocative, that it's easy to get stuck in a "content-hole" where you scroll and scroll - getting nothing out of your time. This is an answer to that. This site will provide a metered content-flow for users, with posting and interaction limits. 


## Contributing

I am open to contributions. If you have a really great idea, feel free to message me and we can talk about it!
